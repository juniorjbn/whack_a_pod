            <dd>Deployments are a Kubernetes control construct that implements 
                your desired state at your desired rate.  In this case, the 
                deployment has the instruction: always have 12 copies of the 
                code base running. The deployment creates a replica set that
                makes keeps 12 copies of the code running at all times. 
            </dd>
            <dt>Pod</dt>
            <dd>One of a set of emphemeral copies of our code base.  
                In this case, it is a simple api that serves up a random 
                hexidecimal color value at /api/color/ on port 80.</dd>
            <dt>Service</dt>
            <dd>Pods are emphemeral, but we need a permanent place to access the 
                the code. A service provides a consistent endpoint where we 
                can access the code that runs in the Pods.  
            </dd>
            <dt>Node</dt>
            <dd>A node is one of the member servers in our Kubernetes cluster. 
                This can be a server running on bare metal or a virtual machine
                in this case, it is running on a Compute Engine virtual machine
                as part of Container Engine cluster.
